Programming since the age of 10, 17 now :) I'm from Quebec, in Canada, thus English is my second language. I love to do web hacking, coding, CTF challenge solving, and development as well as creating writeups for my website. I still don't and can't know everything, that's what I'm always telling myself to motivate me into learning more. I would say that my young age makes it harder for me, but I enjoy the impact I can do on the community.
