### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Noxtal
#### Young programmer, hacking enthusiast and writeup creator

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="https://images.wallpapersden.com/image/download/showtime-retro_65161_1366x768.jpg" /></div>

Programming since the age of 10, 15 now :) I'm from Quebec, in Canada, thus English is my second language. I love to do web hacking, coding, CTF challenge solving, and development as well as creating writeups for my website. I still don't and can't know everything, that's what I'm always telling myself to motivate me into learning more. I would say that my young age makes it harder for me, but I enjoy the impact I can do on the community.


I'm also part of a CTF team: BadByte. We aren't known that much yet, but we are currently training a lot to get better at competitions. We love to help people from our community over on Discord with various things. We also hangout and discuss about our real-life problems. [Here](https://discord.gg/CDACNFg)Â is an invite to it if you want to join!
